There are two nonstandard, special, directories in this repository.

The 'kernel' directory includes kernel headers that are not present in Google's cleaned headers. While I have attempted to clean a new set of headers, I've found the scripts about as usable as writing the next great American novel in 'ed'. 

The 'libc' directory includes headers and source files that define functions not included in Google's non-POSIX compliant libc implementation. 

Non speical directories:

The 'src' directory contains binary source for individual applications. The 'lib' directory contains source code shared between each application that was originally part of libaudit or libev. The 'etc' directory contains configuration specific files.

Configuration notes:
Our port uses the log_file specified in the configuration as a socket for communicating with clients. This log_file will be unlinked whenever auditd starts up so that the socket can be bound.

Disclaimer: The source code requires some serious refactoring after the modifications of the original audit code. Code cleanup of commented out and orphaned code is also needed.

REFACTORING TO DO:
  - Remove syslog dependency and switch to Android's logcat infrastructure.
  - Figure out how to get the old logging code up and running with the new
    AF_UNIX socket code in case people want to write audit logs to the 
    sdcard for whatever reason.

CLEANUP TO DO:
  - Remove GSSAPI related networking
  - Remove TCP related networking -- TCPWrappers etc.
